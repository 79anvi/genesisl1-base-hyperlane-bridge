# Hyperlane: GenesisL1 ↔ Base Bridge

Self-hostable validator and relayer configurations for the **wL1 warp route**
connecting **GenesisL1** (domain 29) and **Base** (domain 8453) via
[Hyperlane](https://hyperlane.xyz).

This repository contains everything needed to:

- Run a **validator** observing either chain and signing checkpoints.
- Run a **relayer** that delivers messages across the route.
- Verify bridge state and monitor operational health.

## Network Overview

| Chain     | Domain | Chain ID | RPC                          | Explorer                       |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |

## The Warp Route

A Hyperlane collateral/synthetic warp route for the native L1 coin, wrapped
to `wL1` (ERC-20, 18 decimals) for cross-chain transfer.

- **Collateral side** (GenesisL1): users wrap native L1 → wL1, then
  `transferRemote(8453, recipient, amount)` locks wL1 in the collateral
  router.
- **Synthetic side** (Base): relayer delivers the message, synthetic wL1 is
  minted on Base to the recipient.
- Reverse direction burns on Base and unlocks on GenesisL1.

Delivery latency: ~20–30 seconds end-to-end in normal conditions.

## Quick Start

### Run a validator

```
sudo N=1 MINIO_KEY=val1 MINIO_SECRET='...' PRIVATE_KEY=0x... \
     BASE_RPCS='https://rpc.ankr.com/base/<YOUR_ANKR_KEY>,https://base-rpc.publicnode.com' \
     bash 1-validator.sh
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GenesisL1/hyperlane-genesisl1-base.git
cd hyperlane-genesisl1-base/validator

cp .env.example .env
# edit .env, fill in HYP_VALIDATOR_KEY

docker compose up -d validator_genesisl1
```

See [docs/validator-setup.md](docs/validator-setup.md) for the full guide.

### Run a relayer

```bash
cd hyperlane-genesisl1-base/relayer

cp .env.example .env
# edit .env, fill in HYP_DEFAULTSIGNER_KEY

docker compose up -d
```

See [docs/relayer-setup.md](docs/relayer-setup.md) for the full guide.
